# Generactive
Educational application to preview some the OOD aspects.

# Project description
We start building our audio visualization application from the scratch. Overall the idea is that users can visualize audio with predefined styles, by just uploading an audio file and choosing a style to render. Obviously, during the course, we are not going to build the application as a whole. For learning purposes, we will try to build an underlying structure and basic functionality.
At this point, we start with Groups and Items.
Groups are containers, have a hierarchical structure, and may contain Items and other groups(sub-groups).
An item is a predefined style, has its price, must be placed in a Group.
